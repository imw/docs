### A self-soveregnity peer-to-peer voting system

Cryptography and distributed p2p systems have brought a new, revolutionary digital technology which might change the way society organizes: blockchain. Among many other applications, it allows decision making through a secure, transparent, distributed and resilent voting system.

In this document we propose the design, architecture and implementation of a self soveregnity peer-to-peer voting platform.

### Design basics

+ Secure and anonymous voting using ZK-snarks
+ Use BlockChain as less as possible
+ Use Smart Contracts to manage the system basics
+ User does not need to directly create BlockChain transactions
+ Data availability via distributed filesystems such as IPFS
+ Use static a web page or APP for interacting with the system
+ Incentivate third parties to participate (relays) by adding a reward system

### Digital identity

As an identity standard Vocdoni uses [Iden3](https://iden3.io).

### Voting process

1. The organizer publish a new election via the Web Frontend or APP

  + Sends a transaction to the Election Smart Contract
    - The funds sent in the transaction will be used for paying the Relay Nodes
    - The amount sent is up to the organizer, so if the election wants preference, they payment should be high enough to overcome other on-going elections
  + Publish the list of required claims for voting
  + Generates a Merkle Tree with all public keys that can vote and makes it accessible (IPFS?)
  + Publish to the Election Smart Contract the following information:
    + Merkle Root Census
    + IPFS hash Census
    + Election ID
    + Duration (#blocks)
    + Encryption PubKey
    + Voting Options
    + Funds

2. The user wants to vote in the new election

  + Verifies that he can vote and gets the Election ID (common for everyone)
  + Generates the nullifier and a random number
  ```
  Nullifier: Hash( election_id + priv_key )
  ```
  + Makes its voting choice and encrypts it with the Organization Pub Key
  ```
  Vote = Encrypt(vote_choice + Random)
  ```
  + Generates a ZK proof to demostrate he/she is in the identity Merkle Tree  
  ```
      -> private input: Private Key, MerkleProof
      -> public input: MerkleRoot, Nullifier, Election ID, Vote

      <- output: Zk-Snark Proof of identity
  ```

  + Generates a Proof of Work (to avoid relay node spaming)

  + Sends the data to the relay voting pool:
      ```
     - Zk-snark proof
     - Vote
     - Nullifier
     - Proof-of-Work nonce
     ```

3. The p2p relay pool receives the data from the user
  + Relay nodes veriffy the PoW and the Zk-snarks proof, if not valid the packet is discarted
  + Choose a set of pending votes to relay
  + Aggregate the votes from several voters in a single packet of data
  + Add the aggregated data to IPFS
  + Upload the IPFS hash to the Blockchain (Ethereum)
  + Keep the data until the end of the election


4. Once the election is finished
  + The organizer publishes the private key, so the votes and proofs are available
  + The organizer checks the votes and validate the relay operation
  + Relay nodes will be rewarded according their contribution
