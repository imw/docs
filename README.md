## A fully verifiable decentralized anonymous voting system

Cryptography and distributed p2p systems have brought a new, revolutionary digital technology which might change the way society organizes: blockchain. Among many other applications, it allows decision making through a secure, transparent, distributed and resilent voting system.

In this document we propose the design, architecture of a decentralized anonymous voting platform using decentralized identities.

## Overview

We want to bring decentralized voting to mass adoption. This requires a solution that has a user experience at the level of current centralized solutions.

+ Minimize transactions to the blockchain. Could potentially be used in Ethereum Mainnet
+ `Voter` does not write, only reads from the blockchain
+ `Voter` can participate with an ultra-light-client (static web/app)
+ Secure vote anonimization using ZK-snarks
+ Data availability via distributed filesystems such as IPFS
+ Economically incentivized, , `relay` network performs actions, not possible by light-clients.

### Identity
The system is agnostic to the identity scheme used.

We are developing our implementation using [Iden3](https://iden3.io), for having the best blance of decentralization vs scalability.

## Definitions
### Actors
`Voter`
+ A `voter` is the end user that will vote
+ Its digital representation we call it `identity`
+ Inside the voting process is identified by a public key
+ Can interact manage all interactions through a light client (web/app)

`Organizer`
+ The user or entity that creates and manages an especific voting process
+ Needs to interact with the blockchain
+ Pays for the costs of a process
+ Has the highest interest for the process to success

`Relay`
+ Is used as a proxy between the `voter` and the blockchain
+ Is a selfish actor. Good behaviour is ensure through economic incentives
+ It may have to be splitted into serveral `relay` types
+ Develops functions that would not be possible on a light client
  - It relays `vote packages` to other `relays`
  - It aggregates `vote packages` and adds them into the blockchain
  - It validates zk-snarks proofs
  - It validates anti-spam proof-of-work nonce
  - It ensures data aviability on IPFS
  - Is responsibile for the data aviability of the `vote packages` it has added (will loose stake if those are not available)
  - It exposes a IPFS proxy
  - It provides Merkle-proofs to `User` requests that they are in the `census merkle tree`
  - It exposes an RPC end-point to the blockchain
  - It should run a full Ethereum node

### Elements

`Process`
+ We call `process` to a especific instance of a `voting process`

`Census Merkle Tree`
+ A Merkle-tree made of the `public keys` of all the `voters`
+ The Merkle-root is hosted in the blockchain as a proof the cenus
+ The tree needs to be publicly available (IPFS) for everyone to verify it.
+ The sk-snarks circuit will use its root to validate if `voter` `public key` is part of it

`Voting smart-contract`
+ All metadata that defines a `process` is stored here
+ The `User` light clients retrieve the `process` data from here
+ All the agragated `vote packages` hashes are added here
+ It holds the funds used to pay the `relays`
+ It holds the funds that the `relays` need to stake to ensure their good behaviour
+ When a `process` is successfully finished it transfers the funds to the `relays`

`ProcessId` (previously "election ID")
+ A unique identifier for each process
+ Generated by the `Voting smart-contract` when a new process is created

`Vote package`
+ Is the set of data sent by the `Voter` to the `relay` in order to vote 
  - Zk-snarks proof
  - Encrypted vote: encrypt(selected `vote options` + random nonce)
  - `Nullifier` : hash( `ProcessId` + `Voter` `private key` )
  - `ProcessId`
  - Anti spam proof of work

`Vote encryption key`
+ Is the public key used by he `Voters` to encrypt their vote
+ Its private key needs to be made publish at the end of the process, for everyone to validate the votes
+ Multiple `vote encryption keys` can be used to ensure that no one has access to the results before the `process` is finished

`Voting options`
+ A potential option for the user to choose when she votes
+ They are published when a `process` is created
+ They could be exclusive or not

`Zk-snarks proof`
+ A `Zk-snarks proof` that proves that the `user` can vote
+ It is generated in the `user` light-client
+ It is an CPU and memory intensive process

### Voting process chronology

1. `Identity` creation
  + Before the process in itself starts `voters` must have their digital `identity`  already created
  + The unique requirement for the those `identities` is that they need to be represented by a `public key`.
  + The system is agnostic to the identity system used but an integration will be required for each of them.

1. The `organizer` generates a census
  + This first design iteration, assumes that the `organizer` has a list of all the `voters` that can participate
  + It agregate all the `public keys` of the `voters` and generates the `census merkle tree` with them.

2. The `organizer` publishes a new voting process.
  + Via a user interface, it fills the required `process metadata` regarding a voting process.
    - Merkle Root  of the `census Merkle tree`
    - `Vote encryption key`
    - Available `voting options`
    - `Process` start time (block number)
    - `Process` end time (block number)
  + Sends a transaction to the `voting smart-contract`
    - It includes the `process metadata`, so its public for the other players
    - The funds sent in the transaction will be used to pay the `relays`
    - The amount sent is proportional to the needs of the `process` (number of participants, relay redundancy...)
  + In parallel it also publishes the `census Merkle tree` to IPFS, to make it available to everyone else.

3. `Voter` votes

  + Gets the `process metadata` from the `voting smart-contract`
  + Gets the census Merkle-proof from a `relay`
  + Checks that can vote
  + Selects the desired `voting options` from the `process metadata`
  + Encrypts the `voting options` and a random nonce with the `vote encryption keys`
    - `vote = encrypt(selected_voting_options + random_nonce)`
  + Generates the nullifier
    - `nullifier = hash( process_id + user_private_key)`
  + Generates a zk-snarks proof to demostrate that she can vote (owns the `public key` and is included in the `census Merkle-tree`)
    - **private input**: `Private Key`, `census tree` Merkle-proof
    - **public input**: `census tree` Merkle-root, `Nullifier`, `ProcessId`, `encrypted vote`
    - **output**: Zk-Snarks proof that she can vote
  + It compiles the `vote package` with
    - `Zk-snarks proof`
    - `Encrypted vote`
    - `Nullifier`
  + Potentially it can encrypt the `vote package` with one or more `relay` public keys in order to minimize IP mapping
  + Generates a Proof-of-Work nonce (to avoid relay node spaming)
  + It sends the `vote package` and the nonce the `relays` pool

  4. `Relays` validate and add the `vote package` into the blockchain
  - The p2p `relay` pool receives the `vote package` from the `user`
  + `Relay` nodes verify the proof-of-work and the `Zk-snarks proof`, if invalid the `vote-package` is discarted
  + Choose a set of pending `vote packages` and aggregate them into a single packet of data
  + Add the aggregated data to IPFS
  + Upload the IPFS hash to the blockchain

4. Once the `process` is finished
  + The owners of the `vote encryption keys` publishes the corrsponding `private keys`, so the votes and proofs are available
  + The `organizer` downloads and verifies the votes
  + The `organizer` makes the `process` closing transaction.
  + 
  + and validates the `relay` operation
  + Relay nodes will be rewarded according their contribution

### Unresolved questions
+ Most of unresolved details are around creating a fully decentralized relay network
  + A centralized trusted `relay` it may still be a valid option in some cases
  + A centralized `relay` makes the system non BFT by not making data available
  + It can also very easly map an IP adresses to votes
  + Unless tunneled with VPN the mapping can be also done by an external observer?

+ How can we minimize IP adress/vote mapping?
  + Multiple encryption with `relay` keys?
  + Can `relays` provide a VPN?
  + Use [I2P](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I2P)
  + Use [Tor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network))
  
+ How to check `relay` bad behaviour? Who checks it? (the `organization?`)
  + Time limits for an un-returned hash?

+ How to choose which relay to encrypt the `vote package` with? How can it be randomized?
+ How a `User` chooses which relay connects to?
+ How does the `relay` pool looks like?
+ How does a `user` validates that her `vote-package` has been added into the blockchain?
  + Does it need to keep downloading every new hash of agregated `vote packages`? 

### Known Weaknesses
- ZK-snarks trusted setup
- IP/vote mapping
